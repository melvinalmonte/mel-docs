This guide will help you(me) setup your local machine for development.

## Git
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
Make sure to have the latest version of Git installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once downloaded and installed, you can check the version of Git by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git --version
```
### Setting up Git

1. Set your name and email address:
	```bash
	git config --global user.name "Mick Mouse"
	git config --global user.email "mickmouse@foo.bar"
	```
	Verify your settings:
	```bash
	git config user.name
	git config user.email
	```

2. Create a new SSH key:
	```bash
	ssh-keygen -t rsa"
	```
3. Add the SSH key to your clipboard and paste it in your GitHub account:
	```bash
	pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	```

## MacOS

### Xcode Command Line Tools
Xcode Command Line Tools includes a GCC compiler, linker, and other utilities. Many useful tools are included in the Xcode Command Line Tools, such as Git, which are not included in the macOS by default.

To install the Xcode Command Line Tools, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
verify the installation:
```bash
xcode-select -p
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```
### Homebrew
	
Homebrew is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's macOS.
	
Installing Homebrew will also install the Xcode Command Line Tools. So, you can skip the first step if you haven't installed the Xcode Command Line Tools.
	
To install Homebrew run the following command in your terminal:
	
Install without proxy:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Install behind proxy:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -vvv -x http://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@proxy.com:<PORT> -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
brew --version
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
Homebrew x.x.x
```

### Kitty
Kitty is a fast, featureful, GPU based terminal emulator. It offloads rendering to the GPU and uses OpenGL for fast, cross-platform performance on modern hardware.

To install Kitty run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
brew install --cask kitty
```
#### Preferred Theme
[Rasmus]("https://github.com/kvrohit/rasmus.nvim/blob/main/extras/kitty/rasmus.conf") theme for Kitty.

Go to `~/.config/kitty` and create a file named `current-theme.conf` and paste the following content in it:
```bash
# Rasmus colorscheme for kitty
cursor #b6b6b5
foreground #d1d1d1
background #1a1a19
selection_foreground #d1d1d1
selection_background #2a2a29
color0  #333332
color8  #4c4c4b
color1  #ff968c
color9  #ffafa5
color2  #61957f
color10 #7aae98
color3  #ffc591
color11 #ffdeaa
color4  #8db4d4
color12 #a6cded
color5  #de9bc8
color13 #f7b4e1
color6  #7bb099
color14 #94c9b2
color7  #d1d1d1
color15 #eaeaea

active_tab_foreground   #d1d1d1
active_tab_background   #323231
inactive_tab_foreground #b6b6b5
inactive_tab_background #222221

active_border_color   #3a3a39
inactive_border_color #323231
inactive_text_alpha   0.8
```
### Auto-Suggestions
For auto-suggestions in the terminal my preferred choice is [zsh-autosuggestions]("https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions").

To install zsh-autosuggestions run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
brew install zsh-autosuggestions
```
To activate the autosuggestions, add the following at the end of your `.zshrc`:
```bash
source $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
```
You will also need to restart your terminal for this change to take effect.


### VIM
Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.
I prefer to keep things simple and use the default vim that comes with MacOS with some minor tweaks.

Add the following to your `.vimrc` file:
```vim
syntax on

set number

set relativenumber

set autoindent

set smartindent

set smarttab

set expandtab

set hlsearch

nnoremap <SPACE> <Nop>

let mapleader=" "

set encoding=UTF-8

set wrap

set nocompatible

set laststatus=2

" PLUGINS
call plug#begin()
  Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
  Plug 'https://github.com/dracula/vim.git'
  Plug 'ryanoasis/vim-devicons'
  Plug 'ayu-theme/ayu-vim'
call plug#end()

set termguicolors
let ayucolor="dark" 
colorscheme ayu

nnoremap <leader>n :NERDTreeFocus<CR>
nnoremap <C-n> :NERDTree<CR>
nnoremap <C-t> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
nnoremap <C-f> :NERDTreeFind<CR>
```

Run `:PlugInstall` to install the plugins.
